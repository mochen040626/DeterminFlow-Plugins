# Chapter cold-reader review loop

This is a pre-commit review loop for every autonomously produced chapter. It
keeps reader judgement distinct from prose generation and turns that judgement
into a reproducible file contract.

## Sequence

1. Draft A is written inside the active chapter transaction and passes the
   deterministic format, degeneration, AI-pattern, and reader-metric checks.
2. `mvp-reader-review` reads the manuscript, binding chapter card, contracts,
   context pack, and current state. It writes one versioned round report:
   `analysis/chapter-reader-review-chXXXX-rNN.json`.
3. `scripts/chapter-reader-review.js validate` checks the exact schema, score
   ranges, chapter identity, and that each issue quote literally occurs in the
   reviewed manuscript. The report stores that manuscript SHA-256.
4. The reviewer also supplies literal proof for five scene legs: the
   protagonist's goal, obstacle, turn, visible mini-payoff, and a concrete
   next-reading hook. The payoff is a result, answer, gain/loss,
   relationship/resource shift, or actionable new fact that the reader receives
   before the hook. A leg not present in the prose is recorded as `missing`
   rather than inferred from the chapter card.
5. A `revise` verdict, any critical issue, a missing scene leg, or a score below
   `chapter_reader_min_score` activates Draft B/C. The revision prompt receives
   both deterministic findings and the validated reader report.
6. Each revision receives a fresh cold-reader round. Only a passing final
   report plus deterministic quality can cross the chapter transaction post
   gate. QA stores a compact audit trail; report rounds remain separately
   hashable by `project-audit.js`.

## Configuration

`settings/agent-runner.json` defaults to:

```json
{
  "chapter_reader_review": true,
  "chapter_reader_min_score": 7,
  "chapter_revision_passes": 2
}
```

Turn the loop off only for a targeted diagnostic slice with
`--chapter-reader-review false`. It does not replace the independent three-reader
pilot panel before a large project advances beyond chapter 3, nor the periodic
cross-chapter review.

## Report contract

Required scores are `clarity`, `continuation`, `fanqie_fit`,
`character_agency`, and `payoff`, each from 0 through 10. Issues contain a
stable code, `critical` or `warning` severity, literal manuscript evidence,
and a repair instruction. The reviewer does not edit source files.

`scene_evidence` contains exactly `goal`, `obstacle`, `turn`, `payoff`, and
`hook`. Each
item has `status` (`present` or `missing`), `evidence`, and `note`. A `present`
item must quote a contiguous literal manuscript excerpt; a `missing` item needs
an explanatory note. The validator writes `scene_missing` into the normalized
report and rejects `pass` when any required leg is missing.

## Candidate selection and plateau

Before the first repair, the runner snapshots Draft A in
`state/chapter-revisions/ch-XXXX-r00.md`. Each repair round gets a deterministic
brief at `analysis/chapter-revision-brief-chXXXX-rNN.md`, then is reviewed and
archived with a JSON decision record. The selection order is:

1. fewer deterministic defects;
2. fewer reader blocks, critical issues, missing scene legs, or below-threshold dimensions;
3. at equal debt, a reader-score gain of at least `0.25`.

Any candidate that adds deterministic defects, worsens reader debt, or plateaus
is saved for audit and replaced by the prior accepted manuscript. The chapter
then remains uncommitted so the outer production attempt can start fresh rather
than repeatedly degrading the same prose.
