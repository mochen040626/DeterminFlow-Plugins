# Autopilot runner

`autopilot-runner.js` is the executable bridge for a single-start production
run. It combines the frozen workflow manifest, chapter transactions, local
context packs, deterministic gates, blind-reader evidence, review slices and
handoff. It never treats an agent response as a committed artifact until the
file exists and its gate has passed.

## Commands

```powershell
node scripts/autopilot-runner.js start <PROJECT>
node scripts/autopilot-runner.js run <PROJECT> --model "MODEL" --max-chapters 4
node scripts/autopilot-runner.js status <PROJECT>
node scripts/autopilot-runner.js stop <PROJECT> --code OPERATOR_PAUSE --reason "..."
```

The model is selected by `settings/agent-runner.json`, `--model`, or
`LNW_AGENT_MODEL`. The executable is selected by `agent_command`,
`--agent-command`, or `LNW_AGENT_COMMAND`; this keeps Claude, a local adapter,
or another CLI interchangeable. Timeouts, retry limits, chapter range, panel
attempts, review interval and adapter flags (`agent_args`) are persisted in the
project config.

## Durable behavior

1. `start` freezes the workflow manifest and creates
   `state/autopilot-run.json` plus `state/autopilot-run-ledger.jsonl`.
2. Preparation nodes run in order: `build`, `character`, `story-plan`, and
   `outline`. Each attempt stores its prompt and transcript in
   `state/agent-runs/`; a missing artifact or failed process consumes one
   retry and leaves the previous checkpoint intact.
3. Each chapter is wrapped by `chapter-transaction begin -> chapter card ->
   Draft A -> deterministic checks + cold-reader report -> bounded Draft B/C
   repair -> candidate selection -> quality checks -> finish -> post-hoc`.
   Every repair receives a versioned brief and snapshot. A candidate is retained
   only when its measurable quality or reader debt improves; a plateau restores
   the prior draft. State is advanced only around the post gate; a failed post
   gate restores the previous project state and records an aborted transaction.
4. Before chapter 4 in a 300k+ project, three or more role-separated cold-reader
   sessions produce raw reports. Two or more configured models are labeled
   `cross_model_independent`; one model is labeled
   `role_separated_not_independent` and still requires distinct role protocols,
   deterministic chapter receipts, and the same thresholds. A weak panel pauses
   production and stores the reports; a bounded repair pass may rewrite chapters
   1-3 before a second panel attempt.
5. Every `review_interval` chapters, a cross-chapter review artifact is
   required. At chapters 10/30/100/400, `longform-gate.js` additionally checks
   quality history, unresolved repair debt, stall/fatigue/upgrade-decay health,
   and completion recovery before the next chapter. Reaching `target_words`
   writes `state/handoff-current.md` and changes both runtimes to
   `complete`/`completed`.

Before a new book starts, `deep-breakdown-gate.js` requires a source-backed
10-20-book benchmark pool, a 1500+ character seven-dimension breakdown, and
traceable B## IDs before `preproduction-gate.js` compiles Book DNA. Run
`production-readiness.js` to see the single current evidence status. Published
queue items also require a hash-bound platform metrics export before they are
considered fully unattended-ready.

## Post-review recovery receipt

After deterministic checks and an accepted cold-reader report, the runner
writes `state/post-review-checkpoint.json` before fact extraction. It binds the
active transaction, chapter-card hash, manuscript path and SHA-256, and the
accepted reader-report path. If only `mvp-fact-extract` exits transiently, a
retry retains this receipt and resumes from fact extraction: it does **not**
ask the writer to make a second Draft A or ask the reader to review unchanged
prose again.

Any manuscript, chapter-card, transaction, report, or acceptance-state drift
invalidates the receipt. The runner then follows the ordinary abort/quarantine
and fresh-draft path. The receipt is removed once the chapter commits or an
unsafe recovery path aborts, while its retention and resume events remain in
`state/autopilot-run-ledger.jsonl`.

The runner respects pilot rejection, paused supervision, locked canon and the
pilot thresholds. A stop is a state transition, not a log message: the exact
code, reason, current chapter, word count and latest agent transcript remain
queryable through `status`.
